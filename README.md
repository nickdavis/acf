**Still in beta**

A library for easily adding Advanced Custom Fields groups to your WordPress website.

## Installation instructions

Currently this library is still in beta mode, but when it's release ready, the plan is to add it to Packagist.org so it can be included as a Composer dependency.

For now you can simply clone the GitHub repo and then include it in your project.

## Credits

Thanks to Tonya Mork and Alain Schlesser for the inspiration for this project.
